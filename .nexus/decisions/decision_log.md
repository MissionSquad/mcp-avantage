# Decision Log

## 2024-08-01 - Initial Setup & Technology Choices

-   **Context:** Need to create an MCP server to expose Alpha Vantage API functionality to LLMs.
-   **Decision:**
    *   Use the standard generic MCP server template (Node.js, TypeScript, FastMCP, Zod, ResourceManager).
    *   Wrap the existing `@j4ys0n/avantage` library instead of interacting with the Alpha Vantage API directly.
    *   Implement tools corresponding to all major methods available in `@j4ys0n/avantage`.
    *   Use the standard `extraArgs`/`.env` pattern for Alpha Vantage API key handling.
    *   Use the `ResourceManager` to manage instances of the `AVantage` class, keyed by API key.
-   **Rationale:**
    *   Leveraging the existing `avantage` library saves significant effort compared to re-implementing all API calls and response parsing.
    *   The generic MCP template provides a robust foundation for multi-user support, configuration, and resource management.
    *   Managing `AVantage` instances via `ResourceManager` ensures efficiency and proper credential isolation.
-   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   Directly calling Alpha Vantage API from MCP tools (more work, less maintainable).
    *   Not using `ResourceManager` (less efficient, potential issues with concurrent requests using different keys).
-   **Consequences:** The MCP server is dependent on the `@j4ys0n/avantage` library. Tool implementation involves mapping parameters and handling the library's specific return structure (`{ error?, reason?, data? }`).
