# Technology: @j4ys0n/avantage Library

## Context

The core requirement is to expose Alpha Vantage API functionality via MCP. An existing TypeScript library, `@j4ys0n/avantage`, already wraps this API.

## Goal

Provide access to Alpha Vantage data (stocks, forex, crypto, fundamentals, indicators, etc.) through the MCP server.

## Decision

Utilize the `@j4ys0n/avantage` library as the primary means of interacting with the Alpha Vantage API, rather than making direct HTTP calls from the MCP server tools.

## Rationale

-   **Code Reuse:** Leverages existing, typed code specifically designed to interact with the Alpha Vantage API.
-   **Reduced Effort:** Avoids the significant effort of re-implementing calls for dozens of API endpoints, handling various parameters, and parsing complex JSON/CSV responses.
-   **Maintainability:** Offloads the responsibility of keeping up with Alpha Vantage API changes (to some extent) to the underlying library maintainer. The MCP server focuses on the wrapping and protocol layer.
-   **Typing:** The library provides TypeScript types for API parameters and responses, which can be used to generate Zod schemas and improve tool implementation safety.
-   **Existing Logic:** The library already includes logic for API key handling, base URL construction, and response formatting/parsing.

## Alternatives Considered

-   **Direct API Calls:** Making `axios` or `fetch` calls directly from each MCP tool to the Alpha Vantage API. This would require re-implementing parameter construction, response parsing, and error handling for every endpoint, significantly increasing complexity and development time.

## Consequences

-   The MCP server becomes dependent on the `@j4ys0n/avantage` library. Its features, limitations, and potential bugs directly impact the server.
-   The MCP tools need to adapt to the specific method signatures and the `{ error?, reason?, data? }` return structure of the library's methods.
-   Updates to the `avantage` library might require corresponding updates to the MCP server's tool implementations or schemas.
-   The server relies on the library's internal handling of premium endpoints and configuration (like the `AV_PREMIUM` flag).
