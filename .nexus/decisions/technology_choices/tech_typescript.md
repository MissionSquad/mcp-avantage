# Technology: TypeScript

## Context

A programming language is needed to implement the MCP server logic and interact with the `@j4ys0n/avantage` library.

## Goal

Develop a robust, maintainable, and type-safe MCP server application.

## Decision

Use TypeScript (v5.x) as the primary programming language.

## Rationale

-   **Static Typing:** Catches errors during development, improving code reliability, especially when dealing with complex API structures from Alpha Vantage and defining MCP tool schemas.
-   **Enhanced Developer Experience:** Provides features like autocompletion, refactoring, and better code navigation, crucial for managing a server with many tools.
-   **Integration:** Integrates seamlessly with Node.js, FastMCP, Zod, and the underlying `@j4ys0n/avantage` library (which is also written in TypeScript).
-   **Maintainability:** Type annotations make the code easier to understand, refactor, and maintain over time.
-   **Modern Features:** Allows use of modern JavaScript features (async/await, classes, modules) compiled down for Node.js compatibility.

## Alternatives Considered

-   **Plain JavaScript (ES6+):** Would lack the safety and developer experience benefits of static typing, increasing the risk of runtime errors and making schema definition/validation less integrated.

## Consequences

-   Requires a compilation step (`tsc`) to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
-   Introduces TypeScript-specific dependencies (`typescript`, `@types/*`, etc.).
-   Leverages TypeScript features like interfaces and generics for defining tool parameters and interacting with the `avantage` library's types.
