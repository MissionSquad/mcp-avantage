# Technology: @missionsquad/fastmcp

## Context

The project requires implementing a server that adheres to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification to communicate with Language Learning Models (LLMs).

## Goal

Provide a robust and efficient foundation for building the MCP server, handling protocol details, tool definition, request routing, and response formatting.

## Decision

Use the `@missionsquad/fastmcp` library as the core framework for the MCP server.

## Rationale

-   **MCP Compliance:** Specifically designed to handle the intricacies of the MCP protocol.
-   **Simplified Development:** Provides high-level abstractions (`FastMCP` class, `server.addTool()`) that simplify the process of defining tools and handling requests compared to manual protocol implementation.
-   **Zod Integration:** Built-in integration with Zod for declarative definition and automatic validation of tool parameters.
-   **Context Propagation:** Supports passing contextual information (`context.extraArgs`) alongside tool arguments, which is essential for the chosen multi-user API key handling strategy.
-   **Standard Transport:** Includes standard transport mechanisms like `stdio`, suitable for typical MCP deployments.
-   **Error Handling:** Provides `UserError` class for distinguishing between internal server errors and errors that should be reported back to the LLM.

## Alternatives Considered

-   **Manual MCP Implementation:** Implementing the entire MCP request/response handling logic manually over stdio. This would be complex, error-prone, and time-consuming.
-   **Other Potential MCP Libraries:** While other libraries might exist, FastMCP is designed for this specific use case and integrates well with the desired template structure.

## Consequences

-   Adds `@missionsquad/fastmcp` as a project dependency.
-   The server structure and tool definition follow FastMCP's conventions.
-   Relies on FastMCP for handling the underlying MCP communication protocol.
