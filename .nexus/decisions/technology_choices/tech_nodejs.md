# Technology: Node.js

## Context

A runtime environment is needed to execute the MCP server code, which is written in TypeScript.

## Goal

Provide a suitable server-side runtime environment for an I/O-bound application (making many external API calls) that integrates well with the TypeScript ecosystem.

## Decision

Use Node.js (v20 or later) as the runtime environment.

## Rationale

-   **Asynchronous I/O:** Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven architecture is highly efficient for applications like this MCP server that spend significant time waiting for responses from the external Alpha Vantage API.
-   **TypeScript Support:** Excellent tooling and community support for TypeScript development.
-   **NPM Ecosystem:** Access to a vast range of libraries, including `@missionsquad/fastmcp`, `@j4ys0n/avantage`, `axios`, `zod`, `dotenv`, etc.
-   **Performance:** Modern Node.js versions offer good performance suitable for this type of application.
-   **Common Choice:** A standard and widely adopted choice for building backend services, APIs, and tooling, especially within the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.

## Alternatives Considered

-   **Deno / Bun:** Newer runtimes for JavaScript/TypeScript. While potentially offering performance benefits or different features, Node.js provides broader compatibility and ecosystem maturity currently.
-   **Other Languages (Python, Go, Java, etc.):** Would require writing the server and potentially the Alpha Vantage wrapper (if `@j4ys0n/avantage` wasn't used) in a different language, moving away from the TypeScript focus.

## Consequences

-   The server is designed to run within a Node.js environment.
-   Requires Node.js v20+ to be installed for development and deployment.
-   Leverages Node.js APIs and its module system (`Node16` specified in `tsconfig.json`).
