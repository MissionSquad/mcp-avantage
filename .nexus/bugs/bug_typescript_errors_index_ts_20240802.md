# Bug Report: TypeScript Errors in src/index.ts

## Context

During compilation (`tsc`), multiple TypeScript errors were reported in `src/index.ts`. These errors primarily relate to type mismatches in the `context` object passed to the `executeAvantageTool` function and incorrect event handler signatures/accessors for `FastMCP`.

-   **File:** `src/index.ts`
-   **Related:** [Server Structure](../../architecture/server_structure.md), [Technology Choice: FastMCP](../../decisions/technology_choices/tech_fastmcp.md)

## Problem Description

1.  **Incorrect Context Type:** The `execute` functions defined using `server.addTool` receive a `context` object from `FastMCP`. This object was being passed to `executeAvantageTool`, but TypeScript reported that the `requestId` property was missing (`Argument of type 'Context<undefined>' is not assignable...`). This indicated a type inference issue or mismatch between the expected type in `executeAvantageTool` and the type provided by `FastMCP`.
2.  **Incorrect Event Accessor:** The `connect` and `disconnect` event handlers were attempting to access `event.clientId`, but the actual event object structure provided by `FastMCP` contains the client identifier within `event.session.id`.
3.  **Invalid Error Event Handler:** The code attempted to register an event handler using `server.on('error', ...)`. However, `'error'` is not a valid event key according to the `FastMCPEvents` type definition, causing a type error. Error handling is managed elsewhere (e.g., `uncaughtException`, `unhandledRejection`, `UserError`).

## Goal

Fix the TypeScript errors in `src/index.ts` to allow successful compilation and ensure correct type handling.

## Solution Implemented

1.  **Explicit Context Typing:**
    *   Imported the `Context` type from `@missionsquad/fastmcp`.
    *   Explicitly typed the `context` parameter in *all* `execute` lambda functions passed to `server.addTool`. This helps TypeScript correctly infer and validate the type against the `executeAvantageTool` function's expectation.
    ```typescript
    import { FastMCP, UserError, Context } from '@missionsquad/fastmcp'; // Added Context import
    // ...
    server.addTool({
      name: 'alphaIntelligence_newsSentiments',
      description: 'Fetches market news and sentiment data from Alpha Vantage.',
      parameters: schemas.NewsSentimentsParamsSchema,
      // Explicitly type context
      execute: (args, context: Context<z.infer<typeof schemas.NewsSentimentsParamsSchema>>) =>
        executeAvantageTool('alphaIntelligence_newsSentiments', args, context, (av, params) => av.alphaIntelligence.newsSentiments(params)),
    });
    // Applied similarly to ALL server.addTool calls
    ```
2.  **Corrected Event Accessor:**
    *   Modified the `connect` and `disconnect` event handlers to use `event.session.id` instead of `event.clientId`.
    ```typescript
    server.on('connect', (event) => {
      logger.info(`Client connected: ${event.session.id}`); // Changed to event.session.id
    });

    server.on('disconnect', (event) => {
      logger.info(`Client disconnected: ${event.session.id}`); // Changed to event.session.id
    });
    ```
3.  **Removed Invalid Error Handler:**
    *   Removed the `server.on('error', ...)` block as it was causing a type error and general error handling is covered by other mechanisms.

## Status

-   **Resolution:** Fixed.
-   **Verification:** Code now compiles successfully with `tsc`.
